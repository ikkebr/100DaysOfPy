# 100 days of Python

Following the initiative of my friend [Helber Belmiro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/helber-belmiro-b5286021/), who is almost done with his 100 days of Java, I have decided to start my 100 days of Python.

For the next 100 days I will be posting commented Python code snippets to this repository and sharing these snippets on social media.

 1. [Binding names to objects](day1.py)
 2. [Playing with different types](day2.py)
 3. [Operations with variables](day3.py)
 4. [Handling keyboard input](day4.py)
 5. [Printing things in many different ways](day5.py)
 6. [Simple if statement](day6.py)
 7. [If-else statement](day7.py)
 8. [If-elif-else statement](day8.py)
 9. [Lists!](day9.py)
