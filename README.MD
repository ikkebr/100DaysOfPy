# 100 days of Python

Following the initiative of my friend [Helber Belmiro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/helber-belmiro-b5286021/), who is almost done with his 100 days of Java, I have decided to start my 100 days of Python.

For the next 100 days I will be posting commented Python code snippets to this repository and sharing these snippets on social media.

 1. [Binding names to objects](day1.py)
 2. [Playing with different types](day2.py)
